## 🟢 **MVP Phase (Day 1 – Launch)**

### 🔧 **Feature Implementation**

- Backend integration[^1]
- Forms
- Loading states[^2]
- Basic error states[^3]

### ✅ **Code Quality**

- State management[^11] (React state, Context API)
- Type checking[^4] (TypeScript or PropTypes)
- Scalable folder structure[^5]
- Centralized styles[^6]

### 🧑‍💻 **User Experience**

- Input validation[^7]
- Basic accessibility[^8]

### 🚀 **DevOps & Environment**

- Version control discipline[^9]
- `.env` setup and environment configs
- Basic CI pipeline[^10]
- Security basics[^12] (input sanitization, auth handling)

### 📄 **Documentation**

- `README.md`[^17]
- Local development setup[^18]
- Optional: high-level project structure overview
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic

---

## 🟡 **Post-MVP (Short-Term / First Iterations)**

Start adding as the product stabilizes:

### 🧪 **Testing**

- Begin with unit tests for key logic
- Gradually increase coverage

### 🏗 **Structure & Maintainability**

- Centralized logging[^13]
- Centralized error handling[^14]
- Robust state management (only if needed)

### ⚡ **Performance**

- Lazy loading
- Resource caching[^15]

### ♿ **Accessibility Enhancements**

- Keyboard nav, ARIA labels, focus management[^8]

### 📊 **Observability & Analytics**

- Add basic tracking and monitoring

### 📘 **Documentation Enhancements**

- API structure and endpoints[^19]
- Component usage via Storybook[^20]
- Error codes reference
- How to contribute (for teams or open source)
- Changelog or release notes

---

## 🔵 **Post-MVP (Long-Term / Scaling Phase)**

For long-term maintainability, scalability, and team onboarding:

### 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n)**

- Externalized strings and localization setup[^16]

### 🧪 **Testing Coverage**

- Full suite: unit, integration, and e2e tests

### ⚙️ **Advanced CI/CD**

- Preview deployments
- Rollback strategies
- Secure secrets and environment segregation

### 🔍 **Monitoring & Observability**

- Detailed monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Datadog)
- Request tracing and health metrics

### 🔐 **Security Enhancements**

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Auth refresh flows and token handling

### 🎨 **Design & UI Systems**

- Custom theming
- Shared component libraries

### 📚 **Documentation: Long-Term**

- System architecture overviews (diagrams, Mermaid)[^19]
- Deployment and CI/CD docs
- Full user-facing documentation (Docusaurus, GitBook)
- Internal training or onboarding guides

## 📎 Footnotes

[^1]: Abstract it slightly if API is likely to change.
[^2]: Critical for async clarity and perceived performance.
[^3]: Use minimal try/catch and user-friendly messages.
[^4]: Use TypeScript or PropTypes early to reduce future bugs.
[^5]: Choose scalable conventions from the beginning.
[^6]: Keep UI consistent; even a basic style system helps.
[^7]: Crucial for data integrity and user trust. Use schemas like Yup/Zod.
[^8]: Start small: labels, focus rings, and semantic HTML go a long way.
[^9]: Use branching strategy, clear commit messages, and PR reviews.
[^10]: Automate linting and testing on pull requests.
[^11]: Avoid overengineering but don’t rely only on prop drilling.
[^12]: Sanitize input, avoid exposing secrets, and validate server-side too.
[^13]: Use a logging abstraction or service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket).
[^14]: Consolidate error display and logging logic.
[^15]: Optimize reactively once usage patterns are clear.
[^16]: Externalize strings even if translation isn’t needed yet.
[^17]: Include purpose, setup steps, and basic commands.
[^18]: Explain `.env`, scripts, required services, dev flow.
[^19]: Document public API surface and endpoints.
[^20]: Helps others consume reusable components correctly.
