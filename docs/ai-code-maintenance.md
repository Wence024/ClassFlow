# **Engineered Prompt for AI Agent**

**Objective:** You are a senior software engineer AI agent. Your task is to perform a comprehensive code quality and testing pass on the `lovable` branch of the ClassFlow project. The goal is to ensure the branch is stable, free of errors, and ready for a final review before being merged into the main branch.

**Workflow:** You will execute the following process in a strict, sequential order:

1. **Linting Pass:** Lint the entire project and fix all issues. Commit the changes.
2. **Type Checking Pass:** Type-check the entire project and fix all errors. Commit the changes.
3. **Iterative Testing Pass:** Process a specific list of test files one by one. For each file, ensure it exists, passes its tests, and then commit the changes.
4. **Final Verification Pass:** Run all checks and tests one last time to ensure full project stability.

---

## **Step 1: Full Project Linting Pass**

1. Execute the linting command: `npm run lint:fix`.
2. Analyze the output for any remaining errors that were not auto-fixed. Apply the necessary code changes to resolve **all** linting issues.
3. Once the command `npm run lint` passes with zero errors, create a single Git commit for all the linting-related changes.
    * **Commit Example:** `style(lint): :art: resolve all ESLint errors and warnings`

---

## **Step 2: Full Project Type Checking Pass**

1. Execute the type checking command: `npm run typeCheck`.
2. Analyze the output for any TypeScript errors. Apply the necessary code changes to resolve **all** type errors.
3. Once the type check passes with zero errors, create a single Git commit for all the type-checking-related changes.
    * **Commit Example:** `fix(types): :construction_worker: resolve all TypeScript errors across the project`

---

## **Step 3: Iterative Testing Pass (RE-PRIORITIZED)**

Please check `git diff --name-only feat/program-department-relation` to check for files to test.

**Sub-Workflow (for each file):**

1. Announce the target file you are now processing.
2. Check if the file exists. If it does not, create it with the correct boilerplate and a placeholder test.
3. Execute the test for **only this file**: `npx vitest run {path/to/the/current/file}`.
4. Analyze the test output. If it fails, modify the source code or the test file itself until the test passes.
5. Once the test for the current file passes, create a dedicated Git commit for the specific changes made to pass this test. The scope of the commit should be the feature being tested.
    * **Commit Example:** `test(timetabling-conflicts): :white_check_mark: add cross-program conflict detection test`

---

## **Step 4: Final Verification Pass**

After all individual test files have been processed and committed, perform a final, full-system check.

1. Execute `npm run lint`. Fix any new issues.
2. Execute `npm run type-check`. Fix any new errors.
3. Execute the full test suite: `npm run test`. Fix any failing tests.
4. If any changes were made during this final pass, create a final commit.
    * **Commit Example:** `chore(quality): :broom: perform final lint, type, and test pass`

---

## **Commit Message Specification**

All commits MUST adhere to the following rules:

* **Format:** `type(scope): :gitmoji: shortMessage\n\nlongMessage`
* **Tense:** Use the imperative, present tense in the short message (e.g., "add feature," not "added feature").
* **Brevity:** Do not repeat the scope in the short message. For `test(auth)`, a good message is "verify admin-only access", not "test auth for admin-only access".
* **Scope:** Use a descriptive scope. For small, targeted changes, prefer a more specific scope (e.g., `style(session-cell)`) over a general one (e.g., `style(timetabling)`).
* **Warning Footer:** If a commit is unusually large and its changes are too broad to be concisely described (e.g., a major refactor), add a `Warning:` footer to the long message. Example:

    ```git
    refactor(timetabling): :recycle: restructure timetable data flow

    This refactor modifies the entire data flow from the services through
    the hooks and into the UI components to support semester-based scoping.

    Warning: This commit is large as it touches all layers of the
    timetabling feature to implement the new data model.
    ```
