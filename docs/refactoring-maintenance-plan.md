# Maintenance & Refactoring Strategy

This document outlines the strategy and principles for maintaining the long-term health and quality of the UniScheduleWeave codebase. It is a strategic guide, while the specific, actionable tasks are tracked in the [**TODO.md**](./TODO.MD) file.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Prioritize User Experience**: Refactoring efforts should be prioritized based on their impact on performance, stability, and usability for the end-user.
2. **Follow the Roadmap**: All maintenance tasks should align with the development phases outlined in the [**Coding Guidelines**](./coding-guidelines.md).
3. **Data Integrity is Paramount**: Changes to services or hooks must not compromise the consistency and security of user data. All data mutations should be handled carefully, leveraging transactions for complex operations where necessary.
4. **Leave it Better Than You Found It**: When working on a feature, take the time to address any small code smells, add missing documentation, or improve type safety in the files you touch.

## Code Health Monitoring

The need for refactoring is identified through several channels:

- **Automated Tooling**: ESLint and TypeScript compiler errors are considered blockers and must be fixed immediately.
- **Code Reviews**: The Pull Request process is our primary mechanism for identifying architectural inconsistencies, potential bugs, and areas for improvement.
- **Performance Profiling**: Using React Developer Tools and browser performance audits to identify slow renders or bottlenecks, especially in the `Timetable` component.
- **User Feedback**: Direct feedback from users or bug reports often highlight underlying architectural issues that need to be addressed.

## Refactoring Strategy

Refactoring is an ongoing process, not a separate phase. Our strategy is as follows:

1. **Identify and Document**: When a potential refactoring is identified, it should be documented as an issue or added to the `TODO.md` file with a clear description of the problem and the proposed solution.
2. **Prioritize**: Tasks are prioritized based on the urgency and impact (Critical, High, Medium, Long-Term) in the `TODO.md` file. This ensures we are always working on the most valuable improvements.
3. **Implement with Tests**: Any significant refactoring of business logic (e.g., in `utils` or `hooks`) must be accompanied by unit or integration tests to prevent regressions.
