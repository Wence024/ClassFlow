# Department-Based Resource Management Implementation Plan

## **Problem Analysis**

The current system has a fundamental data model issue where program heads create their own instructors and classrooms, which bypasses the class merging feature. This creates several problems:

1. **Resource Duplication**: Multiple program heads create the same instructor/classroom
2. **Bypassed Merging**: Class merging doesn't work because resources are program-specific
3. **No Centralized Management**: No single source of truth for institutional resources
4. **No Cross-Program Coordination**: Programs can't share resources effectively

## **Proposed Solution: Department-Based Resource Management**

### **New Role Hierarchy**

1. **Admin**: Full system access, manages all resources
2. **Department Head**: Manages instructors and classrooms for their department
3. **Program Head**: Manages class assignments within their program (assigned to a department)

### **New Data Model**

#### **1. Departments Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.departments (
    id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name text NOT NULL,
    code text NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT departments_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

#### **2. Updated User Profiles**
```sql
-- Add department_id to profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN department_id uuid REFERENCES public.departments(id);

-- Update role enum to include department_head
ALTER TYPE user_role ADD VALUE 'department_head';
```

#### **3. Updated Instructors Table**
```sql
-- Remove user_id, add department_id
ALTER TABLE public.instructors 
DROP COLUMN user_id,
ADD COLUMN department_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.departments(id),
ADD COLUMN created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id); -- Track who created it
```

#### **4. Updated Classrooms Table**
```sql
-- Remove user_id, add department_id  
ALTER TABLE public.classrooms
DROP COLUMN user_id,
ADD COLUMN department_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.departments(id),
ADD COLUMN created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id); -- Track who created it
```

#### **5. Resource Requests Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.resource_requests (
    id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    requester_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    resource_type text NOT NULL CHECK (resource_type IN ('instructor', 'classroom')),
    resource_id uuid NOT NULL,
    requesting_program_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.programs(id),
    target_department_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.departments(id),
    status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
    requested_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
    reviewed_at timestamp with time zone,
    reviewed_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    notes text,
    CONSTRAINT resource_requests_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## **Current Status & Immediate Priorities**

### **‚úÖ Completed (Class Merging Implementation)**

2. **Effective Class Merging**: Resources can be shared across programs
3. **Better Resource Utilization**: No duplication of instructors/classrooms
4. **Clear Permission Boundaries**: Department heads manage their resources
5. **Cross-Program Coordination**: Programs can request resources from other departments
6. **Audit Trail**: Track who created and approved resources

## **Risk Mitigation**

1. **Data Migration**: Comprehensive backup and rollback plan
2. **User Training**: Clear documentation for new role-based workflows
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement in phases to minimize disruption
4. **Fallback Options**: Maintain ability to revert to old model if needed
