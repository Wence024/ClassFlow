# ClassFlow User Guide

Welcome to UniScheduleWeave! This guide will help you get started with creating and organizing your class schedule.

## Core Concepts

- **Components**: These are the building blocks of your schedule. There are four types:
  - **Courses**: The subjects being taught (e.g., "Introduction to Programming").
  - **Class Groups**: The group of students taking the class (e.g., "Section A").
  - **Instructors**: The people teaching the courses.
  - **Classrooms**: The physical locations where classes are held.
- **Class Sessions**: A "Class Session" is a specific combination of one Course, one Group, one Instructor, and one Classroom. These are the items you will place on the timetable.
- **Timetable**: The main grid where you can visually schedule your Class Sessions.

## How to Build Your Schedule: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Add Your Components

Before you can schedule anything, you need to define your building blocks.

1. Navigate to the **Manage Classes** page from the sidebar.
2. Use the tabs at the top (**Courses**, **Class Groups**, **Classrooms**, **Instructors**) to switch between component types.
3. For each type, fill out the "Create" form and add all the components you will need for your schedule. They will appear in the list below the form.

### Step 2: Create Your Class Sessions

Now, combine your components into schedulable classes.

1. On the **Manage Classes** page, create the combinations you need. For example, you might create a session for:
    - "Intro to Programming" (Course)
    - For "Section A" (Group)
    - Taught by "Dr. Smith" (Instructor)
    - In "Room 101" (Classroom)

### Step 3: Schedule on the Timetable

This is where you visually build your schedule.

1. Navigate to the **Timetable** page from the sidebar.
2. You will see all the Class Sessions you created in the **"Available Classes"** drawer at the bottom.
3. Simply **drag** a class from the drawer and **drop** it onto an empty, dashed slot in the timetable grid.
4. The system will automatically prevent you from creating conflicts (like scheduling the same instructor in two places at once).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Why canâ€™t I drop a class in a certain spot?**
    If a red notification appears, it means there is a conflict. The message will tell you if it's an instructor, classroom, or group conflict. Try a different time slot.

- **How do I move a scheduled class?**
    Just drag the class from its current position on the grid and drop it into a new, valid time slot.

- **How do I remove a class from the schedule?**
    Drag the class from the timetable grid and drop it back into the "Available Classes" drawer at the bottom.

- **Is my data saved automatically?**
    Yes. All changes you make are saved instantly and securely. You can log out and log back in from any device, and your schedule will be there.
