# Refactoring Status: Role-Based Vertical Slicing

## ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (COMPLETED)

### 1.1 Directory Structure
- ✅ Created `src/features/program-head/`
- ✅ Created `src/features/department-head/`
- ✅ Created `src/features/admin/`
- ✅ Created `src/features/shared/`
- ✅ Created `src/lib/services/`
- ✅ Created `src/types/` (global types)

### 1.2 Consolidated Services Layer
All database operations have been consolidated into `lib/services/`:

- ✅ `classSessionService.ts` - Class session CRUD operations
- ✅ `resourceRequestService.ts` - Resource request operations
- ✅ `timetableService.ts` - Timetable assignment operations
- ✅ `instructorService.ts` - Instructor CRUD operations
- ✅ `classroomService.ts` - Classroom CRUD operations
- ✅ `courseService.ts` - Course CRUD operations
- ✅ `classGroupService.ts` - Class group CRUD operations
- ✅ `userService.ts` - User management operations
- ✅ `departmentService.ts` - Department CRUD operations
- ✅ `programService.ts` - Program CRUD operations
- ✅ `notificationService.ts` - Notification operations
- ✅ `authService.ts` - Authentication operations

### 1.3 Global Types
Extracted all domain types to `src/types/`:

- ✅ `classSession.ts`
- ✅ `classGroup.ts`
- ✅ `classroom.ts`
- ✅ `course.ts`
- ✅ `instructor.ts`
- ✅ `resourceRequest.ts`
- ✅ `timetable.ts`
- ✅ `user.ts`
- ✅ `department.ts`
- ✅ `program.ts`
- ✅ `index.ts` - Centralized export

## ✅ Phase 2: Program Head Feature Migration (COMPLETED)

### Use Cases to Migrate:
- ✅ 2.1 Create Class Session (PILOT COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/program-head/create-class-session/`
  - Files: component.tsx, hook.ts, service.ts, types.ts, index.ts
  - Follows vertical slice architecture pattern
  - Uses infrastructure services from `lib/services/`
  
- ✅ 2.2 Schedule Class Session (Timetable) (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/program-head/schedule-class-session/`
  - Encapsulates timetabling workflow including:
    * Assignment, move, and remove operations
    * Conflict detection logic
    * Drag-and-drop state management
    * Multi-view mode support (class-group, classroom, instructor)
  - Demonstrates separation of complex business logic from presentation
  
- ✅ 2.3 Request Cross-Department Resource (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/program-head/request-cross-dept-resource/`
  - Encapsulates cross-department resource request workflow including:
    * Resource eligibility checking via DB function
    * Request confirmation modal
    * Navigation to scheduler for assignment
  - Separates cross-dept request logic from class session creation
  
- ✅ 2.4 View Pending Requests (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/program-head/view-pending-requests/`
  - Encapsulates viewing and managing outgoing resource requests including:
    * Fetching user's own requests
    * Dismissing reviewed requests
    * Cancelling pending/approved requests
    * Request status filtering and display
  
- ✅ 2.5 Manage Sessions (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/program-head/manage-sessions/`
  - Encapsulates class session management including:
    * List view with filtering
    * Edit session details
    * Delete sessions with cascade handling
    * Search and filter capabilities

### Pilot Learnings:
- Vertical slice pattern successfully separates concerns
- Service layer acts as thin wrapper over infrastructure services
- Hook encapsulates all business logic and side effects
- Component remains pure presentation layer
- Types provide use-case specific contracts
- Pattern scales well even for complex features (timetabling with drag-and-drop)

## ✅ Phase 3: Department Head Feature Migration (COMPLETED)

### Use Cases to Migrate:
- ✅ 3.1 Approve Cross-Department Request (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/department-head/approve-request/`
  - Encapsulates approval workflow using DB function
  - Hook handles loading states and toast notifications
  
- ✅ 3.2 Reject Cross-Department Request (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/department-head/reject-request/`
  - Includes rejection message validation
  - Uses DB function for atomic rejection and restoration
  
- ✅ 3.3 Manage Instructors (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/department-head/manage-instructors/`
  - Encapsulates instructor CRUD operations with department scoping
  - Migrated from AdminInstructorManagement.tsx
  - Supports both admin (cross-department) and department head views
- ✅ 3.4 View Department Requests (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/department-head/view-department-requests/`
  - Fetches requests for department with filtering
  - Supports status and resource type filters

## ✅ Phase 4: Admin Feature Migration (COMPLETED)

### Use Cases Migrated:
- ✅ 4.1 Manage Users (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/admin/manage-users/`
  - Encapsulates user CRUD operations with filtering
  - Uses infrastructure services for user management
  
- ✅ 4.2 Manage Departments (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/admin/manage-departments/`
  - Full CRUD operations for departments
  - Integrates with department service layer

- ✅ 4.4 Manage Classrooms (COMPLETED)
  - Created vertical slice: `src/features/admin/manage-classrooms/`
  - Encapsulates classroom CRUD operations for admins
  - Migrated from ClassroomTab.tsx
  - Includes department preference prioritization
  
- ⏳ 4.3 System Configuration (DEFERRED)
  - To be addressed when specific configuration requirements are defined

## ✅ Phase 5: Shared Features Migration (COMPLETED)

- ✅ 5.1 Authentication Restructure (COMPLETED)
  - Moved authentication from `src/features/auth/` to `src/features/shared/auth/`
  - Updated all imports throughout the codebase
  - Fixed ES module compatibility in build verification script
  - Centralized shared authentication functionality
  
- ✅ 5.2 Global State Optimization (COMPLETED)
  - Fixed import paths in timetabling hooks to use shared auth

## ✅ Phase 6: Routes Reorganization (COMPLETED)

- ✅ 6.1 Role-based Route Configuration (COMPLETED)
  - Created `src/routes/AdminRoutes.tsx` - Admin-only routes
  - Created `src/routes/DepartmentHeadRoutes.tsx` - Department head routes
  - Created `src/routes/ProgramHeadRoutes.tsx` - Program head routes
  - Created `src/routes/SharedRoutes.tsx` - Routes for all authenticated users
  - Created `src/routes/index.tsx` - Centralized route exports
  
- ✅ 6.2 Route Guards Update (COMPLETED)
  - Maintained RoleGuardedPage wrapper for role-based access control
  - Routes organized by role in App.tsx for better clarity
  - All routes properly guarded with appropriate role requirements

## ⏳ Phase 7: Testing Migration (PENDING)

- ⏳ 7.1 Reorganize Tests by Use Case

## ⏳ Phase 8: Cleanup (PENDING)

- ⏳ 8.1 Remove Old Feature Directories
- ⏳ 8.2 Update Documentation

---

## Key Benefits Already Achieved

1. **Centralized Data Layer**: All database operations now in one place (`lib/services/`)
2. **Type Safety**: Global types ensure consistency across the codebase
3. **Clear Foundation**: Directory structure ready for feature migration
4. **Better Navigation**: Easy to find any database operation
5. **Role-Based Routes**: Clear separation of routes by user role
6. **Consistent Architecture**: Vertical slice pattern applied across all features

## Next Steps

1. Phase 7: Testing Migration - Reorganize tests to match vertical slice structure
2. Phase 8: Cleanup - Remove deprecated code and update documentation

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Old code still works**: Existing features still import from original locations where not migrated
- ⚠️ **No breaking changes yet**: This is a foundation phase only
- ✅ **Routes reorganized**: All routes now organized by role for better maintainability
